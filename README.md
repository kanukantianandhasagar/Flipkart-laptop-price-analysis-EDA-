# Flipkart-laptop-price-analysis-EDA-
Project Description

This project is a web scraping and data analysis task focused on extracting, cleaning, and analyzing laptop pricing data from Flipkart, one of India‚Äôs leading e-commerce platforms. The goal is to collect key product information such as brand, price, processor, RAM, storage, and display features, and perform exploratory data analysis to derive insights about laptop pricing trends.

üìå Objectives
Scrape laptop product data from Flipkart using requests and BeautifulSoup.

Extract relevant specifications: Brand, Price, Processor, RAM, Storage, Operating System, etc.

Perform cleaning and transformation of the data.

Conduct basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on laptop pricing.

Understand how various specifications influence the price.

Technologies Used
Python üêç

Libraries:

requests

BeautifulSoup

re (Regex)

pandas

matplotlib, seaborn (for EDA and visualization)

 Data Pipeline Overview
Data Collection:

Used web scraping to gather product listings from Flipkart search results for "laptops".

Data Extraction:

Parsed HTML content to extract:

Product names and brands

Price tags

Specifications like RAM, Processor, Storage, OS

Data Cleaning:

Used regex and string operations to clean and format extracted text data.

EDA & Visualization:

Analyzed how pricing varies by brand, processor type, RAM size, etc.

Created visual plots (bar charts, histograms) to display trends.

 Key Insights (to be confirmed after EDA is finalized)
Certain brands (e.g., Dell, HP, Lenovo) dominate specific price ranges.

RAM and processor type significantly impact the laptop‚Äôs price.

SSD storage models are generally priced higher than HDD-based models.

 Future Enhancements
Automate scraping across multiple pages and categories.

Implement advanced visual analytics (e.g., heatmaps, correlation matrices).

Use machine learning to predict laptop prices based on features.
